Samuraizer is a Python-based data analysis and processing tool with both command-line (CLI) and graphical (GUI) interfaces. It is designed to provide deep insights into local file systems and Git repositories, with fast, scalable processing powered by caching, streaming, and parallelism. The project emphasizes a modular architecture, allowing easy extension of analysis, output formats, and user interfaces.

Known caveat: there are a few minor bugs mentioned by maintainers; these are tracked and resolved as time allows.

## üß∞ Tech Stack

- Python 3.9+ (core logic, CLI, and scripting)
- PyQt6 (GUI)
- SQLite (cache)
- GraphViz (DOT output)
- xxHash (fast hashing)
- python-magic (file type detection)
- NetworkX / PyVis (visualizations)
- Colorama / tqdm (CLI UX)

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

Prerequisites
- Python 3.9+ (virtual environments recommended)
- Qt 6 (for GUI)
- Graphviz (for DOT/visualization)

Windows:
- Install Python 3.9+
- Install Graphviz
- Install dependencies in a virtual environment

Linux/macOS:
- Install Python 3.9+
- Install Qt 6 and Graphviz
- Create and activate a virtual environment, then install dependencies

Installation Methods

1) Using pip (Recommended)
```bash
# Create and activate virtual environment
python -m venv venv
# Linux/macOS
source venv/bin/activate
# Windows
venv\Scripts\activate

# Install the package
pip install samuraizer
```

2) From Source
```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/luricodes/Samuraizer.git
cd Samuraizer

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Development dependencies (optional)
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt

# Install package in editable mode
pip install -e .
```

## üöÄ Quick Start

CLI mode
- Analyze a directory and output to a file
```bash
samuraizer /path/to/analyze -o output.json
```

- Choose a format
```bash
samuraizer /path/to/analyze -o output.yaml -f yaml
```

- Streaming mode for large datasets
```bash
samuraizer /path/to/analyze -o output.jsonl -f jsonl --stream
```

- Include binaries
```bash
samuraizer /path/to/analyze -o output.json --include-binary
```

- Advanced options
```bash
samuraizer /path/to/analyze -o output.json \
  --threads 8 \
  --max-size 100 \
  --follow-symlinks \
  --hash-algorithm xxhash \
  --encoding utf-8
```

GUI mode
- Launch GUI
```bash
samuraizer_gui
```

- The GUI offers file/folder selection, output settings, analysis configuration, real-time progress, and rich visualizations.
- The included usage GIF demonstrates drag-and-drop, graphs, and export workflows.

Note: The CLI and GUI share the same core analysis engine and output pipeline, but expose different configuration surfaces.

## üìê Configuration

CLI Options (highlights)
- root_directory: Directory to analyze
- -o, --output: Output file path
- -f, --format: Output format (json|yaml|xml|jsonl|dot|csv|sexp|msgpack)
- --stream: Enable streaming mode
- --include-binary: Include binary files
- --exclude-folders, --exclude-files, --exclude-patterns: Exclusion controls

Unified configuration is stored in a single TOML file managed by the unified configuration manager.  
Default location: `~/.config/samurai/config.toml` on Linux/macOS or `%APPDATA%\samurai\config.toml` on Windows.  
Both CLI (`--config`, `--profile`) and GUI share this file, including support for configuration profiles.

```toml
config_version = "1.0"

[analysis]
default_format = "json"
max_file_size_mb = 50
threads = 4
follow_symlinks = false
include_binary = false
encoding = "auto"
cache_enabled = true
include_summary = true

[cache]
path = "~/.cache/samurai"
size_limit_mb = 1000

[output]
compression = false
streaming = false
pretty_print = true

[theme]

```

Cache System
- SQLite-based cache in a .cache folder

Data Flow Outline
1) User provides root_directory and options via CLI or GUI
2) Cache is initialized or connected (xxHash pathway)
3) Directory structure is traversed (or streamed) by traversal modules
4) Analysis pipeline extracts metadata, content, and structure
5) Output is formatted by OutputFactory into the chosen format
6) Results saved to disk with progress updates and error handling
7) Cleanup and resource finalization
